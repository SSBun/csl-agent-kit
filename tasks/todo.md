# Current Skills Audit

## Plan

- [x] Inventory repository structure and current skill manifests.
- [x] Review existing lessons and project documentation.
- [x] Audit skill files for structure, trigger clarity, safety rules, and maintainability.
- [x] Check supporting scripts, commands, and docs for broken references or drift.
- [x] Write findings and recommendations to `docs/analysis/current-skills-audit.md`.
- [x] Add a review section with verification evidence.

## Review

Report created: `docs/analysis/current-skills-audit.md`

Verification performed:

- `find skills -maxdepth 2 -type f -name SKILL.md`
- `find . -maxdepth 3 -type f -print`
- `git status --short --untracked-files=all`
- `bash -n scripts/install.sh`
- `jq . .claude-plugin/plugin.json .cursor-plugin/plugin.json .codex-plugin/plugin.json .claude-plugin/marketplace.json .cursor-plugin/marketplace.json .agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
- Checked `analyze-project` prompt references to templates and `docs/analysis` output paths.

Top findings:

- `handoff-restore` has a contradictory existing-file branch.
- `venom-cli` classifies `gen-asset-code` as read-only even though it generates code.
- `beautiful-mermaid` and `venom-cli` instruct global npm installs without explicit approval.
- `code-reviewer` reference docs still contain placeholder content.
- `scripts/install.sh` needs safer symlink target checks.

# Current Skills Optimization Plan

## Plan

- [x] Re-read the audit report and existing task records.
- [x] Group all findings into implementation phases.
- [x] Write a complete optimization plan with acceptance criteria.
- [x] Add verification commands and manual review checklist.
- [x] Verify the plan document and workspace status.

## Review

Plan created: `docs/analysis/current-skills-optimization-plan.md`

The plan covers all 18 audit findings across four phases:

- Phase 1: Safety and workflow correctness.
- Phase 2: Installer and CI hardening.
- Phase 3: Skill content quality.
- Phase 4: Documentation and platform alignment.

Verification performed:

- Read `docs/analysis/current-skills-optimization-plan.md`.
- Confirmed 18 numbered optimization items with `rg -n "^### [0-9]+\\."`.
- Checked workspace status with `git status --short --untracked-files=all`.

# Current Skills Optimization Implementation

## Plan

- [x] Split implementation into disjoint file groups for subagents.
- [x] Fix safety and workflow skill issues.
- [x] Harden installer, ignore policy, and CI validation.
- [x] Replace placeholder review references and tune interaction skills.
- [x] Align platform command/spec documentation.
- [x] Run verification commands from the optimization plan.
- [x] Review workspace status and summarize changed files.

## Review

Implementation completed across four file groups:

- Safety/workflow skills: `handoff-restore`, `venom-cli`, `beautiful-mermaid`, `release`, `handoff-save`, `sop-creator`.
- Installer/CI: `scripts/install.sh`, `.gitignore`, `.github/workflows/validate.yml`, `README.md`.
- Skill content quality: `code-reviewer` references, `same-page`, `brainstorming`, `figma-describe`.
- Platform docs: `commands/sop-activate.md`, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-04-figma-describe-design.md`.

Verification performed:

- `bash -n scripts/install.sh`
- `git diff --check`
- `jq .` across all plugin and marketplace manifests
- Skill frontmatter validation loop from CI
- Command frontmatter validation loop from CI
- Analyze-project prompt docs path validation loop from CI
- Source keyword scan for removed unsafe/stale patterns
- `git status --short --untracked-files=all`

# SOP Routing Index

## Plan

- [x] Create a lightweight built-in SOP index under `skills/sop-creator/sops/`.
- [x] Add an `AGENTS.md` routing prompt that points procedural work to the index.
- [x] Update `sop-creator` lookup guidance to read the built-in index before individual built-in SOPs.
- [x] Verify index references and workspace status.

## Review

Created `skills/sop-creator/sops/INDEX.md` as a lightweight router for built-in SOPs.

Created `AGENTS.md` with the requested format:

- Do not read SOP files by default.
- For procedural work only, consult `skills/sop-creator/sops/INDEX.md`.
- Do not read unrelated SOP files.

Updated `skills/sop-creator/SKILL.md` so built-in SOP lookup reads the index first.

Verification performed:

- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Read `skills/sop-creator/sops/INDEX.md`.
- Checked index references with `rg`.
- Verified referenced SOP files exist.
- Checked `git status --short --untracked-files=all`.
